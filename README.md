## 🧠 Problem Statement  
HealthAI addresses **Problem Statement 1** from the _Code for Care: AI & Tech for Preventive Healthcare_ hackathon.  
It is designed to enable **early prediction of lifestyle diseases** using **self-reported data**, eliminating the need for costly diagnostics.

> Predicts risks for:
- **Type 2 Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Overall Chronic Disease Risk**

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧬 Multi-Model Disease Prediction
- **Model 1: Diabetes Risk Classifier**  
  Based on PIMA Indian dataset — binary prediction (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic)
  
- **Model 2: Heart Disease Predictor**  
  Based on Cleveland Heart Disease dataset — binary prediction
  
- **Model 3: Overall Lifestyle Disease Risk**  
  Aggregates features and outputs to predict **Low / Medium / High** risk strata

### 🧠 Explainable AI
- Feature attribution using **SHAP** for transparency
- Users can see what factors contribute most to their predicted risk

### 🎯 Personalized Recommendations
- Context-aware health suggestions based on risk
- Covers:
  - Weight & diet goals
  - Activity & stress plans
  - Screening reminders

### 🖥️ Clean & Minimal UI
- Easy-to-use web interface for input and results
- Displays risk levels, top factors, and recommended actions
